## Summary
As senior data analyst at Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications, you are given data
to the most recent animal study. In this particular study, 249 mice who had SCC tumors received treatment with different drug regimens. 
Over 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose was to compare the effectiveness of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens. This was done by using bar graphs, pie charts, box plots, line graphs and scatter plots. My job was to create these graphs given the data from the company.
